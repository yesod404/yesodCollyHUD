# yesodHUD

A minimalistic custom HUD for Team Fortress 2, base was collyhud created by colly. This HUD was my approach at reworking/updating collyhud, as it is pretty outdated. This originally started as a HUD for myself, but decided to expand it for others.

# Compatibility

This HUD supports every gamemode, including hybrids. Supported customization with fonts, health styles, and many more. This HUD supports 4:3 as well.

The only other bugs of major note are dealing with end of match stuff in Casual, but it is a pain to work with. As well as windows that only 1% of people use :P.
